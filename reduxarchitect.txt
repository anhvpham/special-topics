User clicks to open different tab that change the page content


2. BUtton clicks trigger the flow of data:

Users: click to a button (eg: add new button)

Actions: using type ,descibe the change of the state with extra data for example: username  and password. This action is dispatched to transition to new state

Reduces: take action with initial state and update the state. Tstate is immutable in Redux, always return the new open

Store: all update from reducers get pass as arguments to the store, only one store exists. The store is essentially all your application states/data

Provider: this make the store avaialble to all React container. Connect funtion happens: (eg: mapStateToProps(), map DispatchToprop())

Container: fetch apps state datat and use it to render component. The app state will become component prop here

Component:component created that user will interact , eg: form, buttons
